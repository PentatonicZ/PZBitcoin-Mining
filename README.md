*Mine Bitcoin while the apocalypse rages on.*

## 💾 Overview
**Zomboid Crypto Miner** is a Project Zomboid mod that introduces a new gameplay mechanic: **cryptocurrency mining** using desktop computers. Built for **Project Zomboid Build 41**, this mod lets survivors put their spare power and time to use.....even when the world has ended.

Using vanilla Computers Players can find, install, and operate mining rigs. Over time, these rigs generate in-game "crypto rewards" while consuming electricity and time, offering a unique twist to your survival economy.
