## 💾 Overview
**Zomboid Crypto Miner** is a Project Zomboid mod that introduces a new gameplay mechanic: **cryptocurrency mining** using desktop computers.  
Built for **Project Zomboid Build 41**, this mod lets survivors put their spare power and time to use — even when the world has ended.

Players can find, install, and operate **desktop computers** as mining rigs. Over time, these rigs generate in-game "crypto rewards" while consuming electricity and time, offering a unique twist to your survival economy.

## 🚧 Future Plans / To Do
- 🎵 **Computer Adio** + Ambient computer noise that attracts Z's
- 💻 **Expand UI** - View jobs and lifetime earnings. 
- 🔥 **Overheating System** — rigs that overheat without proper ventilation or cooling.  
- ⚡ **Dynamic Energy Usage** — mining efficiency based on available power.  
- 💰 **Reward System** — tangible in-game crypto rewards with trade or crafting potential.  
- 💬 **Expanded Admin Tools** — better debugging, balance controls, and event triggers.  
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Cybercrime & Hacking** — other players can **hack** discovered mining rigs/computers to steal or take control of mining progress **if** they meet server-designated requirements (a minimum **Lockpicking** and **Electronics** level). Server hosts will be able to configure the required skill thresholds and toggle hacking on/off for balance and roleplay reasons.
